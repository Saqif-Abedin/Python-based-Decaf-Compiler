# Python based Decaf Compiler

This repository contains a Decaf compiler implemented in Python using Ply and Yacc. The compiler provides functionality for parsing, constructing an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), performing semantic analysis, and generating intermediate code. 

## Features

- Parsing with PLY: The compiler utilizes the PLY library for parsing the Decaf language.
- AST Construction: It constructs an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation of the Decaf code to facilitate further processing.
- Semantic Analysis: The compiler performs semantic analysis on the AST to check for correctness and ensure adherence to the language rules.
- Intermediate Code Generation: It generates intermediate code from the AST, which can be further processed or transformed for target architectures.
