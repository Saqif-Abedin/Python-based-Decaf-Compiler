1. decaf_lexer.py:  PLY/lex specification of Decaf tokens.
		            Defines "errorflag" used to signal error during scanning/parsing.
2. decaf_parser.py: PLY/yacc specification of Decaf grammar.
		            Parses through the decaf and makes sure all rules are satisified,
                    if not, errors will be printed.
		            Defines "from_file" function that takes a file name and parses that file's contents.
		            "from_file" returns True if no error, and False if error.
3. decaf_compiler.py:   Processes arguments and gets file name to pass to decafparser.from_file
		                Decaf programs are assumed to be in files with ".decaf" suffix.
                        containing the main python function that ties the modules together,
                        takes the command-line argument of the input file name, and processes the Decaf program in that file.
                        The translated machine instructions will be written to a file with the same base name as the input file,
                        but with a ".ami" extension.
4. decaf_ast.py:    Defines table and class definitions for Decaf's AST.
                    folded in: decaf_typecheck.py: definitions for evaluating the type constraints and for name resolution.
                    folded in: decaf_codegen.py: definitions for generating code
5. decaf_absmc.py: definitions for the abstract machine and for manipulating abstract programs
